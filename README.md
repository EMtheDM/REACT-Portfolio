## Description

Thank you for looking at my portfolio. This portfolio utilizes the ReactJS library to create a single page application. It also utilizes emailJS. A user is able to quickly and intuitively navigate the portfolio to learn more about me, look at my skills and work, as well as contact me by filling out a contact form that uses emailJS.
